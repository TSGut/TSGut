## About Me
I am a Lecturer in Scientific Computing at the University of Leeds. Previously I was a PIMS-Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia and a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oxford after having completed a PhD in applied mathematics at the Imperial College London.

My research focus is the development of computational tools for PDEs, integral equations and fractional differential equations with applications in the natural sciences such as quantum physics and collective behavior in biology, including specifically also machine learning models thereof. I am also more generally interested in computational orthogonal polynomials and their applications in such methods.
