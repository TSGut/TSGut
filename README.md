## About Me
I am a Lecturer in Scientific Computing at the University of Leeds. Previously I was a PIMS-Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia and a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oxford after having completed a PhD in applied mathematics at the Imperial College London.

My research focus is the development of computational algorithms and tools for natural science applications such as molecular quantum physics and collective behavior in biology, including specifically also machine learning models thereof. I am also generally interested in computational orthogonal polynomials and their applications in spectral methods as well as the aforementioned machine learning models.
